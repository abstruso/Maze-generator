# Maze-generator
This is product of academic group project (3 students took part in). I was responsible for maze generators, and I was active during integration of all components.

Our program is capable of generating and solving various mazes, using randomized Kruskal's algorithm and Depth-first search algorithm.
Received maze can be saved to a file with given name.
